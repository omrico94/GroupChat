## Overview  - what is GROUPI?
How many times have you had a question to someone around you and you were to shy?  
At the park, at a conference, at the plane gate in the airport.  
“Where can I find the best CHANGE?”  
“Anyone have an band aid?”  
“Who wants to share a taxi?”  
We often come to a place where we the same interest or needs with the people around us – and we’ll be happy having a conversation with them!  
This is a great time to interduce you -  GROUPI.
